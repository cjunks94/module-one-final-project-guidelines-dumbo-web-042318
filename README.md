Welcome to WeatherCLI App!
This application will allow you to access OpenWeatherMap (please get your own API key from the OpenWeatherMap website, and insert in the "api_communicator.rb" file). Simply put, this is a fun application. It searches data from a large amount of locations around the world. We ask the user to input their preferred location and the program return up to a 5-day forecast.
